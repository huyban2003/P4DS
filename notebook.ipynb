    "Lung cancer is a disease that is not too unfamiliar to us; in fact, it is quite common. We often associate this condition with air pollution or, more commonly, the harmful effects of smoking. In the current situation where air pollution is on the rise, respiratory diseases are becoming more prevalent, making lung cancer more likely to develop. However, lung cancer has various symptoms, and through this dataset based on 1000 surveys, we will explore these symptoms to gain a better understanding and learn how to maintain our health.\n",

    "- **Collect data and License**: From 1000 people from over 462,000 people in China who were followed for an average of six years. This was in the study, which was published in the journal Nature Medicine. The participants were divided into two groups: those who lived in areas with high levels of air pollution and those who lived in areas with low levels of air pollution. The researchers found that the people in the high-pollution group were more likely to develop lung cancer than those in the low-pollution group. They also found that the risk was higher in nonsmokers than smokers, and that the risk increased with age. While this study does not prove that air pollution causes lung cancer, it does suggest that there may be a link between the two. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine what effect different types and levels of air pollution may have on lung cancer risk"
